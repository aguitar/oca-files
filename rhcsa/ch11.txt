1) backup current httpd config
     - cp /etc/sysconfig/httpd /home/student/backups/

2) make sure apache is running
     - service httpd status

3) see how many httpd processes are running
     - ps aux | grep httpd

4) uncomment OPTIONS line and set as:
     - vim /etc/sysconfig/httpd
     - OPTIONS=-l
   the man page says -l will output list of modules loaded into the server

5) restart server
     - service httpd restart
     --> Stopping httpd:                                            [  OK  ]
         Starting httpd: Compiled in modules:
           core.c
           prefork.c
           http_core.c
           mod_so.c
                                                                    [  OK  ]
6) running ps aux | grep httpd again shows no running apache processes

7) restore original httpd config file
     - cp /home/student/backups/httpd /etc/sysconfig/httpd

1) create user hawaii on station12.example.com and tester1.example.com
     - useradd hawaii
     - passwd hawaii

2) on station12.example.com create keypair as user hawaii
     - su - hawaii
     - ssh-keygen

3) make sure that folder ~/.ssh exists on tester1.example.com with proper
   permissions
     - mkdir /home/hawaii/.ssh
     - chmod 700 /home/hawaii/.ssh

3) transfer public key to system you want to log into (tester1.example.com)
   from station12.example.com
     - rsync -P .ssh/id_rsa.pub hawaii@192.168.122.168:/home/.ssh/

4) on tester1.example.com rename the copied id_rsa.pub to authorized_keys and
   set proper permissions
     - cd .ssh
     - mv id_rsa.pub authorized_keys
     - chmod 600 authorized keys

5) on tester1.example.com, modify sshd_config
     - vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     - uncomment and set the following:
       - RSAAuthentication yes
       - PubkeyAuthentication yes
       - AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys
       - PasswordAuthentication no

6) restart sshd on tester1.example.com
     - service sshd restart

7) on station12.example.com make sure the identity is loaded as user hawaii
     - exec ssh-agent bash
     - ssh-add

8) use ssh to connect to remote system
     - ssh hawaii@192.168.122.168
   the user should be taken straight to the command prompt without being asked
