1) on tester1.example.com create RSA keypair:
     - gpg2 --gen-key
2) generate public key from identity
     - gpg2 --export Steven Pequeno > steven_gpg.pub
3) copy .pub file to remote system (station12.example.com)
     - rsync -P steven_gpg.pub student@station12.example.com:/home/student/
4) on station12.example.com import pub file
     - gpg2 --import steven_gpg.pub
5) verify identity was imported 
     - gpg2 --list-keys
6) encrypt file:
     - gpg2 --out mysecret --recipient 'Steven Pequeno' --encrypt 56510-labs.txt
7) copy encrypted file to tester1.example.com
     - rsync -P mysecret student@192.168.122.168:/home/student/
8) on tester1.example.com decrypt file:
     - gpg2 --out labs.txt --decrypt mysecret

not much to do here, inspect /etc/init.d and use rpm -qf on any file
you want more information about. -qf queries the file and returns information
about the package to which that file belongs.

rpm -qf abrtd

rpm -qi abrt-2.0.8-21.el6.centos.x86_64

1) install telnet-sever on server1.example.com and telnet (client) on 
   tester1.example.com
     - yum install telnet-server
2) backup default config
     - cp /etc/xinetd.d/telnet ~/backups/
3) turn telnet on
     - sudo service xinetd start
     - chkconfig telnet on
4) edit telnet config file
     - sudo vim /etc/xinetd.d/telnet
5) add the rule which specifies which ip to accept connections from
   this is the ip of the VM we created: tester1.example.com
     - only_from = 192.168.122.168
6) try to telnet from the localhost (server1.example.com)
   should get error: Connection closed by foreign host.
     - telnet 172.21.101.105
7) try telnet from tester1.example.com. server1.example.com might have to have 
   port 23 tcp/udp opened on firewall to work.
     - telnet 172.21.101.105
8) restore original telnet config file and reload
     - cp /home/student/backups/telnet /etc/xinetd.d/telnet
   edit bottom line which disables telnet by default
     - vim /etc/xinetd.d/telnet
       - set: disable = no
     - service xinetd reload
9) backup current version of /etc/hosts.deny
     - cp /etc/hosts.deny /home/student/backups/
10) edit hosts.deny file and add: telnetd: ALL EXCEPT 192.168.122.168
